### Hi there üëã

### About me
Quantum engineering student passionate about the development and application of quantum technologies. My journey is focused on the development of quantum algorithms and solutions, as well as their application in various domains. I am driven by the possibilities offered by quantum computing to solve complex problems and push current boundaries. Always keeping an eye on the latest advancements in this exciting field, I am determined to contribute to shaping the future of quantum technology .

### üìö Background
Holder of a Bachelor's degree in Fundamental Physics, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Quantum Engineering with a specialization in Quantum Computing. My academic journey has enabled me to acquire a strong foundation in the field of quantum physics and its applications.

During the summer of 2023, I had the enriching opportunity to work at C12 Quantum Electronics as an engineering assistant within the team dedicated to qubit characterization.

### üìù Projets 
Mais projet sont plus orient√© sur la simulation et la modelisation par les m√©thodes num√©rique et la programmation quantique.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Code 
![Isaac's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=darkmatter2000&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&hide=prs,contribs)

My top languages are: Python, Julia & C.

I have experience using: Qiskit, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. 
In my pinned repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
In terms of open source I have worked/contributed to the following repos:
- SeQUeNCe: an open source Simulator of QUantum Network Communication that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. 
- Quantum Universal Education: a community-driven, open-source educational website for learning about all aspects of quantum computing across the full stack, from hardware to algorithms.
- Qiskit: an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and algorithms. 
- QuantumClifford: a simulator of Clifford circuits, graph states, and other quantum Stabilizer formalism tools.
