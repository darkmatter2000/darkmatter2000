### Hi there üëã
An quantum engineering student passionate about the development and application of quantum technologies. My journey is focused on the development of quantum algorithms and solutions, as well as their application in various domains. I am driven by the possibilities offered by quantum computing to solve complex problems and push current boundaries. Always keeping an eye on the latest advancements in this exciting field, I am determined to contribute to shaping the future of quantum technology .

### üìö Background
Holder of a Bachelor's degree in Fundamental Physics, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Quantum Engineering with a specialization in Quantum Computing. My academic journey has enabled me to acquire a strong foundation in the field of quantum physics and its applications.

### üìù Projets 
My projects are focused on quantum programming and simulation, as well as modeling using numerical methods:
- [Solving the Max-Cut problem using the quantum annealing method with a gate-based quantum algorithm.](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/QOSF_Mentorship_program_cohort_9) 
- [Quantum Phase estimation](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/Quantum_phase_estimation) This project is an implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm using the new conditional measurement technique of Qiskit.
- [Quantum phase estimation](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/Quantum_phase_estimation) 
- [Qmole](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/qmole) This project involves the creation of software to simulate simple molecules using quantum algorithms for the simulation calculations.
- [Resolution de l'√©quation de Schr√∂dinger pour un √©l√©ctron dans un potentiel p√©riodique](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/schrodinger_equation_solver_with_finite_elements) In this project, using a finite element method approach, I sought to obtain the band diagram associated with our electron trapped in a periodic potential well. This well is modeled by the Kronig-Penney model.
- [Mix electric problem](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/Energy_Mix_Problem) Quantum optimization algorithms for solving the electricity mix problem in the case of a renewable energy bouquet.

I have a strong experience in using Matlab. For quantum computing, I mainly use the Qiskit framework. I have also explored other tools and libraries such as Xanadu's Pennyland, Quandela's Perceval, and Atos' MyQML.
