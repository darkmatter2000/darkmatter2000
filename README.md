### Hi there üëã

### üìö Background
I am Maria (she/her), an undergraduate Physics student at the University of Bath, who enjoys quantum algorithm design and implementations for Quantum Networking and Simulation systems.
Between 2021/2022 I completed and industrial year-long placement at Cisco's R&D Quantum Networking team. During the Summer 2022 I was a Google scholar for the Google Summer of code. At the moment I am a IBM Quantum Intern & GitHub campus expert, with a strong interest in quantum tech.

### üìù Research 
A lot of my work revolves around quantum networking. You can follow my readings in my Quantum-tech-papers repository.
I have worked in quantum protocol design and testing with Netsquid and Python, a quantum error correction library for Julia's QUantum Clifford tool, and side by side comparisons of quantum networks against classical networks based on various topological distributions.
At the moment I am experimenting with qiskit and error mitigation libraries.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Code 
![Maria's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mgg39&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&hide=prs,contribs)

My top languages are: Python, Julia & C.

I have experience using: Qiskit, as well as various Quantum Discrete event simulators, such as Netsquid and SeQUeNCe. 
In my pinned repositories, you can find examples of my Quantum Discrete event simulations (Python) as well as my personal academic quantum paper library, and one of my projects based on multidimentional superconducting materials (C).
In terms of open source I have worked/contributed to the following repos:
- SeQUeNCe: an open source Simulator of QUantum Network Communication that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. that allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications. 
- Quantum Universal Education: a community-driven, open-source educational website for learning about all aspects of quantum computing across the full stack, from hardware to algorithms.
- Qiskit: an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and algorithms. 
- QuantumClifford: a simulator of Clifford circuits, graph states, and other quantum Stabilizer formalism tools.
