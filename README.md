### Hi there 👋

### About me
Quantum engineering student passionate about the development and application of quantum technologies. My journey is focused on the development of quantum algorithms and solutions, as well as their application in various domains. I am driven by the possibilities offered by quantum computing to solve complex problems and push current boundaries. Always keeping an eye on the latest advancements in this exciting field, I am determined to contribute to shaping the future of quantum technology .

### 📚 Background
Holder of a Bachelor's degree in Fundamental Physics, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Quantum Engineering with a specialization in Quantum Computing. My academic journey has enabled me to acquire a strong foundation in the field of quantum physics and its applications.

During the summer of 2023, I had the enriching opportunity to work at C12 Quantum Electronics as an engineering assistant within the team dedicated to qubit characterization.

### 📝 Projets 
Mes projets sont plus orienté sur la simulation et la modelisation par les méthodes numérique et la programmation quantique:
- ![Resolution de l'équation de Schrödinger pour un éléctron dans un potentiel périodique](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/schrodinger_equation_solver_with_finite_elements) In this project, using a finite element method approach, I sought to obtain the band diagram associated with our electron trapped in a periodic potential well. This well is modeled by the Kronig-Penney model.
- ![Quantum Phase estimation](https://github.com/darkmatter2000/Quantum_phase_estimation) This project is an implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm using the new conditional measurement technique of Qiskit.

### 👩‍💻 Code 
![Isaac's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=darkmatter2000&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&hide=prs,contribs)
![top-langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs?username=darkmatter2000&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

I have a strong experience in using Matlab. For quantum computing, I mainly use the Qiskit framework. I have also explored other tools and libraries such as Xanadu's Pennyland, Quandela's Perceval, and Atos' MyQML.
